## Features

- **Supervised Learning**
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Random Forests
  - Neural Networks (Basic Implementation)

- **Unsupervised Learning**
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

- **Evaluation Metrics**
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - Confusion Matrix

- **Data Preprocessing**
  - Handling Missing Data
  - Feature Scaling (Normalization & Standardization)
  - One-Hot Encoding

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iamkag/Basic-ML-Techniques.git
   cd Basic-ML-Techniques
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the individual scripts to explore different ML techniques. Example:
```bash
python linear_regression.py
```
Modify the datasets or parameters within the scripts to experiment with different scenarios.

## Dataset

The repository includes small sample datasets for demonstration purposes. For larger experiments, you can use datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).
